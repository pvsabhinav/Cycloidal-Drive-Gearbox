# Cycloidal-Drive-Gearbox

**Cycloidal Drive Gearbox Info:**
- 10:1 Gear ratio
- Best used in robotics applications, or applications where low speed and high torque are required
- Estimated total cost to build gearbox is $85 (note: this does not include the motor)
- Important note: I made most of my parts in mm as the motor I found which was a good fit had its dimensions in mm. Most of the parts I bought are also in mm, especially the ones that are related with the motor. 

**Parts List**
- 3D printed parts (all parts to print are in the files above)
- I used an Eaglepower (kv90) brushless motor, but the motor case file can be edited to adapt to any motor
- 2 55x72x9 mm bearing
- M4 Brass Heat-Set threaded inserts (try to get the knurled ones)
- 2 1/2x1-1/8x5/16 **in** bearing (note: this bearing is in inches, not mm, as I could not find a bearing in mm that fit my needs)
- 30 4x8x3 mm bearings
- Assorted M4 Bolts and nuts.
